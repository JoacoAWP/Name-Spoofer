# Name-Spoofer

Change ANY string displayed on your screen visually. It does not actually change any strings and is client side.

Works on: nametags, chest, furnace, inventory, item name, other mods, tablist, chat, any text etc.

## Commands
1. Type `/spoof <name>` to change any instance where your username appears on the screen to `<name>`. Basically Nickhider.

2. Type `/spoof <target> <name>` to change any instance of `<target>` to `<name>`. (Use this if `<name>` has spaces)

3. Type `/remove <target>` to hide the string `<target>`.

NOTE: THESE APPLY TO **ANY** TIME TARGET APPEARS ON YOUR SCREEN INCLUDING CHAT AND YOUR TYPING CHAT (ex: after `/spoof a wow`, "I eat apples everyday" = "I ewowt wowpples everydwowy")

## Features
- Works with replay mod
- Saves color of text and works with color codes (ex: &c[OWNER])

## Notes
- This could potentially conflict with NickHider mod
- Changes text visually so it can change text that is displayed on the screen, such as item names as well
- Add tab completion
- May affect fps if there is a lot of text displayed (such as when you press tab in bedwars lobby one)
