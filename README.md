# Name-Spoofer

Change **ANY** text displayed on your screen visually. 

*It does not actually change any strings and is client side (If you spoof a 1 character string to 5 character it will actually be 1 character, only it will appears as 5)



Works on: nametags, chest, furnace, inventory, any Minecraft item, other mods, gui, tablist, chat, nicknider name, any text etc.

## Commands
1. Type `/spoof <name>` to change any instance where your username appears on the screen to <name>. Basically Nickhider but you decide your name.
2. Type `/spoof <target> <name>` to change any instance of `<target>` to `<name>`. (<name> can have spaces)
3. Type `/remove <target>` to hide the string `<target>`.

NOTE: THESE APPLY TO **ANY** TARGET THAT APPEARS ON YOUR SCREEN INCLUDING CHAT AND YOUR TYPING CHAT (If you tab up chat it might look strange because of this mod)

## Usage
**Example: Change your minecraft ign to Dream** 

`/spoof <name> &c[&fYOUTUBE&c] Dream`

**Example: Give Youtube rank to everyone on hypixel**
1. `/spoof [ &c[`
2. `/spoof ] &c]`
3. `/remove +`
4. `/spoof MVP &fYOUTUBE`
5. `/spoof VIP &fYOUTUBE`
6. `/spoof <playername> &c<Youtuber>`

## Features
- Works with replay mod
- Saves color of text and works with color codes (ex: &c[OWNER])

## Notes
- This could potentially conflict with NickHider mod (but this can replace nickhider)
- Changes text visually so it can change text that is displayed on the screen, such as item names as well
- Add tab completion
- May affect fps if there is a lot of text displayed (such as when you press tab in bedwars lobby one)
